# FightBot
This is a minecraft player bot that can be sent to any server!

To use:
1. Unzip and put anywhere
2. Go in the folder (unzipped) and look for index.js
3. open index.js with any code or text editor (notepad always works)
4. At the top you will see CreateBot() and this is where you will initialize it
  1. Change host to your server IP
  2. If your server IP looks something like 146.356.12.54:23653 then change the port to those 5 numbers. If not then just leave it.
  3. Most servers don't allow you to join without a password. In other words, you may need a spare account, but if you have that then simply put the account's username and       password
 
 
 Edit anything else you want, but this is very risky for it could break at any time. If you know anything about code, edit at your own risk
